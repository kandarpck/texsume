# texsume
Resume created in LaTeX

###Motivation

Google Docs was managable till the undergraduate level. Now, it just feels slow, lacking proper formatting and typesetting tools. I have to resort to weird spaces and tabs since their PDF converter doesn't  deliver a presentable alignment. Well, I don't need Docs collaboration, Git solves the problem of version history and LaTeX simplifies the formatting troubles, giving me a fresh start.

###Format

A one page resume created for professional use. Nothing fancy. No colors, highlighting or multi-pane layout.
